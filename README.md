## Description use case
The time has come to go to another business meeting where you have to give a presentation. You look in the closest and wonder what you wore
to the last meeting. You really need a better way to keep track of when you wore a suit last. You look for applications to solve this dilemma.
This is when you find the Worn-Out App. 

This application will let you pull up that photo you posted to the company site of the last meeting and see what you wore, enter that into the app. 
You list a date that you last wore it and give it a memorable label.
